          <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
        </header>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the primary language used to create web pages, 
          and is read by web browsers in order to display specific content, defined by the code in the HTML. 
          It was invented in 1991 by a man named Tim Berners-Lee, who was also responsible for the invention 
          of the World Wide Web itself, in 1989.
        </p>
        <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces 
          of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is 
          it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three 
          columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
        </p>
        <p>In order to write HTML documents, all you need is a computer, and a simple text editor.

          <h2>HTML editors</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors, however, all you really 
          need is a text editor such as Notepad for PC, or TextEdit for Mac. Both of these text editors can 
          be found pre-installed on their associated devices.
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to become more involved with writing HTML code, and other computer languages, 
          there are plenty of very good dedicated code writing programs to choose from. These include:

          <h2>Elements</h2>
        </header>
        <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. The tag types are specific 
          to the nature of the content between them, and are formatted in a particular way. A start tag begins 
          with a "less than" symbol (&lt;), and ends with a "greater than" symbol (&gt;). An end tag has the same 
          format, but includes a forward slash (/) after the tag name, and before the (&gt;) symbol.
        </p>
        <p>Elements are categorised by the type of tags that are used to define their content. This categorisation 
          can then be used to style the web page to virtually any specification, using tools such as Cascading 
          Style Sheets (CSS). Some of the main tags that you will use within the main content of an HTML document 
          are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul id="tag-list">
          <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>: These tags classify their associated elements 
            as headings, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most important (usually the main heading), down 
            to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> being the least important sub-headings.
          </li>
          <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>: This tag is used to group blocks of content into paragrapghs, so it is 
            distinguishable from headings, other paragraghs, and other elements.
          </li>
          <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>: This tag is used to classify an element as the document's main body, 
            which contains all of the visible content of the document. There can only be one of these elements 
            per HTML document.
          </li>
          <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code>: This HTML tag represents the dominant content of the page of a document. 
            The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic 
            of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="attributes">
        <header>
          <h2>Attributes</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Elements in HTML can have attributes; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust 
          their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want. Attributes are always specified within 
          the start tag, and they usually come in name and value pairs like so: <code>name="value"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Some very common, and important, attributes used in HTML are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>id</code>: Identifies a unique element. It can be used by CSS to reference that element and can 
            also be used by scripting languages to reference the element. Links can be made directly to an element 
            with a specific id. The value of the id attribute must be unique.
          </li>
          <li><code>class</code>: Used to reference elements with CSS. Unlike the <code>id</code> attribute, any 
            number of elements can have the same <code>class</code> value.
          </li>
          <li><code>title</code>: The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information 
            is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. The title attribute can be 
            used on any HTML element.
          </li>   
          <li><code>style</code>: This attribute specifies an inline style for an element, so can therefore be used 
            to apply alternative presentation to the default style. It will override any style set elsewhere, such 
            as in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, and external stylesheets.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>      
      <section class="main-section" id="layout">
        <header>
          <h2>Layout</h2>
        </header>
        <p>HTML code has a few important rules which should be applied to all documents, so that web browsers can 
          read them in the context they were intended.
        </p>
        <p>Firstly, all html files should begin with a document type declaration, which helps browsers display web 
          pages correctly. For the current HTML5 language, the document type should be declared like this: 
          <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. The HTML document types are backwards compatible, meaning, when you 
          declare a document as HTML5, it will still be compatible with older versions. Although it looks like one, 
          document type is not a tag, it is a declaration, and therefore it doesn't need a closing tag at the end of 
          a document, just the one at the very beginning.
        </p>
        <p>The next important rule is to wrap the whole document in <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags. These are tags, 
          so will require a closing tag at the end of the document: <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. This represents the 
          root of the document that contains everything except the document type declaration. The <code>lang</code> 
          attribute should always be used inside the opening tag, in order to specify the language in which the page 
          is intended.
        </p>
        <p>Following the HTML tags should be the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags. These encapsulate specific metadata 
          information about the page that is not displayed to the user. Examples of the type of information that is 
          included here are: Web page title, author, description, character set, and css code or links to external 
          stylesheets. This requires a closing tag.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the last important aspect to the HTML document, is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. As 
          mentioned above, this is used to classify the entire visible portion of an HTML document. It is important 
          to include this element as a distinction between the non-visible <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, and 
          the visible element of the document. It should also have a closing tag at the end of the visible content.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="comments">
        <header>
          <h2>Comments</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Commenting in HTML allows developers to leave notes about their code, its functionality or to indicate 
          necessary changes for the future. Comments remain hidden from the user of a webpage, which is achieved by 
          wrapping the desired text in a start tag <code>&lt;!--</code>, and an end tag <code>--&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Although comments are not imperitive to an HTML document, their mention is justified, as they are a very 
          useful and somewhat necessary tool in understanding what previous authors of code, or indeed your previous self, 
          were tring to achieve.
